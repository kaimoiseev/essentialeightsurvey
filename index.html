Please complete the game to assess the maturity of cybersecurity processes of our University.<br>
The game offers 8 Dungeons, related to the most essential cyber risks mitigation strategies. <br>
For each Dungeon, you will see 5 game characters that represent 5 typical university stakeholders: <br>
<b>		Researcher / Faculty / Student / Administrative employee / Third party provider.</b> <br>
Each stakeholder is to be donned a piece of armour, corresponding to their CS maturity level.<br>
Questions at the lower frame of the screen will help you to determine maturity level for each stakeholder.<br>
Please note that each stakeholder may have varying requirements and rules for their accounts, gadgets, applications, etc. 
Thus, when answering the questions, please consider this difference and check whether a certain Maturity level applies to everyone in the list. <br>
By default, everyone has Level Zero. You can also apply the cross (Not Applicable, N/A) to a character, if cybersecurity rules do not apply to this character at all. <br>
Completing all 8 Dungeons of this adventure makes you eligible for participation in a special closed session of CyberWeek 2025 on cyber resilience and cyber capability maturity models.<br><br>
Upon completing the game, it will offer to save the results in a json file, which we will be happy to receive attached in a reply to our e-mail.<br><br>

This is not a necessary step for completing the survey, but it would provide a bigger picture. <br><br>
